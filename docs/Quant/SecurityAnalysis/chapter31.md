# CHAPTER 31 Analysis of the Income Account

### Simplified Statement of Wall Street’s Method of Appraising Common Stocks.

The Wall-Street method of appraising common stocks has been simplified to the following standard formula:

1. Find out what the stock is earning. (This usually means the earnings per share as shown in the last report.)
2. Multiply these per-share earnings (每股收益) by some suitable "coefficient of quality" which will reflect:
   - a. The dividend rate (股息率) and record.
   - b. The standing of the company (公司的地位) — its size, reputation, financial position, and prospects.
   - c. The type of business (e.g., a cigarette manufacturer will sell at a higher multiple of earnings than a cigar company).
   - d. The temper of the general market. (Bull-market multipliers are larger than those used in bear markets.)

The foregoing may be summarized in the following formula:
$$
\text{Price}=\text{current earnings per share}\times\text{quality coefficient}
$$

### Earnings Not Only Fluctuate but Are Subject to Arbitrary Determination.

It will be illuminating if we summarize at this point the various devices by which the per-share earnings may at the choice of those in control be made to appear either larger or smaller.

1. By allocating items to surplus (盈余) instead of to income, or vice versa.
2. By over-or understating amortization (摊销) and other reserve charges.
3. By varying the capital structure, as between senior securities (优先证券) and common stock. (Such moves are decided upon by managements and ratified by the stockholders as a matter of course.)
4. By the use made of large capital funds not employed in the conduct (经营) of the business.

## CRITICISM AND RESTATEMENT OF THE INCOME ACCOUNT

From the standpoint of common-stock analysis these audited statements (经审计的财务报表) may require critical interpretation and adjustment, especially with respect to three important elements:

1. Nonrecurrent profits and losses (非经常性损益).
2. Operations of subsidiaries or affiliates (子公司经营情况).
3. Reserves (准备金).

### General Observations on the Income Account.

Accounting rules (会计准则) permit the management to decide whether to show these operations as part of the income or to report them as adjustments of surplus. Following are a number of examples of entries of this type:

1. Profit or loss on sale of fixed assets (固定资产).
2. Profit or loss on sale of marketable securities (有价证券).
3. Discount or premium on retirement of capital obligations (清偿资本性债务的折价或溢价).
4. Proceeds of life insurance policies (人寿保险的保单收入).
5. Tax refunds and interest thereon (退税及其利息).
6. Gain or loss as result of litigation (诉讼损益).
7. Extraordinary write-downs of inventory (存货减值).
8. Extraordinary write-downs of receivables (应收账款减值).
9. Cost of maintaining nonoperating properties (维持非经营性资产的成本).

As far as the analyst is concerned, his object requires that all these items be segregated from the ordinary operating results of the year.

Numerous instances have occurred in which the statements are incomplete or misleading because either: (1) they fail to reflect any part of the profits or losses of important subsidiaries (子公司) or (2) they include as income dividends (股息) from subsidiaries that are substantially less or greater than the current earnings of the controlled enterprises (子公司).

The third aspect of the income account to which the analyst must give critical attention is the matter of reserves for depreciation (折旧) and other amortization (摊销), and reserves for future losses and other contingencies (未来亏损和突发事件).

### Nonrecurrent Items: Profits or Losses from Sale of Fixed Assets.

Profits or losses from the sale of fixed assets belong quite obviously to nonrecurrent items, and they should be excluded from the year's result in order to gain an idea of the "indicated earning power".

Examples: A glaring example of this practice is presented by the report of the Manhattan Electrical Supply Company for 1926. This showed earnings of 882,000, or 10.25 per share. But a subsequent application to list additional shares (申请增发股票) on the New York Stock Exchange revealed that out of this 882,000 reported as earned, no less than 586,700 had been realized through the sale of the company’s battery business. Hence the earnings from ordinary operations were only 295,300=88200-586700, or about 3.40 per share.

### Profits from Sale of Marketable Securities.

Profits realized by a business corporation from the sale of marketable securities are also of a special character and must be separated from the ordinary operating results.

Examples: The report of National Transit Company for the year 1928 illustrates the distorting effect due to the inclusion in the income account of profits from this source. The consolidated income account for 1927 and 1928 was stated in approximately the following terms:

|Item|1927|1928|
|--|--|--|
|Operating revenues|$3,432,000|$3,419,000|
|Dividends, interest, and miscellaneous income|463,000|370,000|
|"Operating expenses, including depreciation <br> and profit and loss direct items"<br>(in 1928 "including profits from sale of securities")|3,264,000|2,599,000|
|Net income|$631,000|$1,190,000|
|(Earned per share)|($1.24)|($2.34)|

A study of the detailed figures of the parent company alone, as submitted to the Interstate Commerce Commission, would have revealed that 560,000 of the 1928 income was due to its profits from the sale of securities. This happens to be almost exactly equal to the increase in consolidated net earnings over the previous year (1190000-631000=559000).

### Profits Through Repurchase of Senior Securities at a Discount.

At times a substantial profit is realized by corporations through the repurchase of their own senior securities (优先证券) at less than par value (面值). The inclusion of such gains in current income is certainly a misleading practice.

Example: A peculiar example of this accounting practice was furnished as long ago as 1915 by Utah Securities Corporation, a holding company controlling Utah Power and Light Company. The following income account illustrates this point:

|||
|--|--|
|Earnings of Utah Securities Corporation <br> including surplus of subsidiaries accruing to it|771,299|
|Expenses and taxes|30,288|
|Net earnings|$741,011|
|Profit on redemption of 6% notes|1,309,657|
|Income from all sources accruing to Utah <br> Securities Corporation|$2,050,668|
|Deduct interest charges on 6% notes|1,063,009|
|Combined net income for the year|$987,659|

The foregoing income account shows that the chief "earnings" of Utah Securities were derived from the repurchase of its own obligations at a discount (1309675). Had it not been for this extraordinary item the company would have failed to cover its interest charges (1063009).

A contrary result appears when senior securities are retired at a cost exceeding the face or stated value (优先证券按超过面值或既定值偿还). When this premium involves a large amount, it is always charged against surplus (冲减盈余) and not against current income.

Examples: As prominent illustrations of this practice, we cite the charge of 40,600,000 against surplus made by United States Steel Corporation in 1929, in connection with the retirement at 110 of 307,000,000 of its own and subsidiaries' bonds.
