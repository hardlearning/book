# CHAPTER 7 Bull Spreads Using Call Options

## 7.1 AN INTRODUCTION TO CALL SPREAD STRATEGIES

A spread is a transaction in which one simultaneously buys one option and sells another option, with different terms, on the same underlying security.

All spreads fall into three broad categories: vertical, horizontal, or diagonal.

A vertical spread is one in which the calls involved have the same expiration date but different striking prices.

A horizontal spread is one in which the calls have the same striking price but different expiration dates.

A diagonal spread is any combination of vertical and horizontal and may involve calls that have different expiration dates as well as different striking prices.

### SPREAD ORDER

The term "spread" designates not only a type of strategy, but a type of order (交易指令) as well.

If the total price of the spread results in a cash inflow to the spread strategist, the spread is a credit spread (收入价差). This merely means that the sell side of the spread brings in a higher price than is paid for the buy side of the spread. If there is a cash outflow from the spread transaction, the spread is said to be a debit spread (支出价差). This means that the buy side of the spread costs more than is received from the sell side. It is also common to refer to the purchased side of the spread as the long side (多头腿) and to refer to the written side of the spread as the short side (空头腿).

In the bull spread, one buys a call at a certain striking price and sells a call at a higher striking price. Generally, both options have the same expiration date. This is a vertical spread.

Example: The following prices exist:

- XYZ common, 32;
- XYZ October 30 call, 3; and
- XYZ October 35 call, 1.

A bull spread would be established by buying the October 30 call and simultaneously selling the October 35 call. Assume that this could be done at the indicated 2-point debit. A call bull spread is always a debit transaction, since the call with the lower striking price must always trade for more than a call with a higher price, if both have the same expiration date.
