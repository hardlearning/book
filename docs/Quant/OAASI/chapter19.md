# CHAPTER 19 The Sale of a Put

## 19.1 THE UNCOVERED PUT SALE

Example: XYZ is at 50 and a 6-month put is selling for 4 points. The naked put writer has a fixed potential profit to the upside — 400 in this example — and a large potential loss to the downside.

TABLE 19-1. Results from the sale of an uncovered put.

|XYZ Price at Expiration|Put Price at Expiration (Parity)|Put Sale Profit|
|--|--|--|
|30|20|-$1,600|
|40|10|-600|
|46|4|0|
|50|0|+400|
|60|0|+400|
|70|0|+400|

The collateral requirement for writing naked puts is the same as that for writing naked calls. The requirement is equal to 20% of the current stock price plus the put premium minus any out-of-the-money amount.

Example: If XYZ is at 50, the collateral requirement for writing a 4-point put with a striking price of 50 would be 1,000 (20% of 5,000) plus 400 for the put premium for a total of 1,400.

## 19.5 THE COVERED PUT SALE

By definition, a put sale is covered only if the investor also owns a corresponding put with striking price equal to or greater than the strike of the written put.

For margin purposes, one is covered if he sells a put and is also short the underlying stock.

## 19.6 RATIO PUT WRITING

A ratio put write involves the short sale of the underlying stock plus the sale of 2 puts for each 100 shares sold short.
