# CHAPTER 8 Bear Spreads Using Call Options

## 8.1 THE BEAR SPREAD

In a call bear spread, one buys a call at a certain striking price and sells a call at a lower striking price.

Unlike the bull spread, the bear spread is a credit spread when the spread is set up with call options.

It should be pointed out that most bearish strategies that can be established with call options may be more advantageously constructed using put options.

*Example*: An investor is bearish on XYZ.

- XYZ common, 32;
- XYZ October 30 call, 3; and
- XYZ October 35 call, 1.

A bear spread would be established by buying the October 35 call and selling the October 30 call. This would be done for a 2-point credit, before commissions. In a bear spread situation, the strategist is hoping that the stock will drop in price and that both options will expire worthless.

- Maximum profit potential = Net credit received
- Break-even point = Lower striking price + Amount of credit
- Maximum risk = Collateral investment required = Difference in striking prices - Credit received + Commissions
