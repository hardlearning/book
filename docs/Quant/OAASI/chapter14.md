# CHAPTER 14 Diagonalizing a Spread

When one uses both different striking prices and different expiration dates in a spread, it is a diagonal spread. (对角价差)

## 14.1 THE DIAGONAL BULL SPREAD

The diagonal bull spread consists of buying a longer-term call at the lower strike and selling a near-term call at the higher strike.

By diagonalizing the spread, the position is hedged somewhat on the downside in case the stock does not advance by near-term expiration. Moreover, once the near-term option expires, the spread can often be reestablished by selling the call with the next maturity.

Example: The following prices exist:

||Strike|April|July|October|Stock Price|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|XYZ|30|3|4|5|32|
|XYZ|35|1|1.50|2|32|

To compare a vertical bull spread with a diagonal spread, the following two spreads will be used:

- Vertical bull spread: buy the April 30 call, sell the April 35 — 2 debit
- Diagonal bull spread: buy the July 30 call, sell the April 35 — 3 debit

TABLE 14-1. Comparison of spreads at expiration.

|XYZ Price at April Expiration|April 30 Price|April 35 Price|July 30 Price|Vertical Bull Spread Profit|Diagonal Spread Profit|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|20|0|0|0|-$200|-$300|
|24|0|0|0.50|-200|-250|
|27|0|0|1|-200|-200|
|30|0|0|2|-200|-100|
|32|2|0|3|0|0|
|35|5|0|5.50|+300|+250|
|40|10|5|10|+300|+200|
|45|15|10|15|+300|+200|

## 14.2 OWNING A CALL FOR "FREE"

*Example*: XYZ is at 32 and the near-term April 30 call is selling for 3 points while the longer-term July 35 call is selling for 1.50 points. A diagonal bear spread could be established by selling the April 30 and buying the July 35.

## 14.3 DIAGONAL BACKSPREADS

Using the foregoing prices, one might sell the April 30 for 3 points and buy 2 July 35's at 1.50 points each. This would be an even money spread (平价价差). The credits equal the debits when the position is established. This strategy is merely the diagonalizing of a backspread (对角后式价差).

If the April 30 call expires worthless, which would happen if the stock was below 30 in April, the spreader would own 2 July 35 calls for free. Even if the April 30 does not expire totally worthless, but if some profit can be made on the sale of it, the July 35's will be owned at a reduced cost.
