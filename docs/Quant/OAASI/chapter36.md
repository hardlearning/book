# CHAPTER 36 The Basics of Volatility Trading

## 36.1 DEFINITIONS OF VOLATILITY

The historical volatility is a measure of how fast the underlying instrument has been changing in price.

The implied volatility is the option market's prediction of the volatility of the underlying over the life of the option.

Historical volatility can be measured with a formula for standard deviation.

## 36.4 IMPLIED VOLATILITY

If implied volatility is too high, options will be overpriced. That is, they will be relatively expensive. On the other hand, if implied volatility is too low, options will be cheap or underpriced.

\text{Opt price}=f(\text{Stock price},\text{Strike price},\text{Time},\text{Risk-free rate},\text{Volatility},\text{Dividends})

## 36.5 THE VOLATILITY OF VOLATILITY

What this means is that one not only needs to know the current percentile of implied volatility, but he also needs to know the range of numbers over which that percentile was derived. If the range is wide, then an extreme percentile truly represents a cheap or expensive option. But if the range is tight, then one should probably not be overly concerned with the current percentile of implied volatility.

The range of implied volatility for near-term options is greater than it is for longer-term options.

It's important for anyone using implied volatility in his trading decisions to understand that the range of past implied volatilities is important, and to realize that the volatility range expands as time shrinks.

### IS IMPLIED VOLATILITY A GOOD PREDICTOR OF ACTUAL VOLATILITY?

Implied volatility is really not a very good predictor of the actual volatility.

## 36.6 VOLATILITY TRADING

The volatility trader's main objective is spotting situations when implied volatility is overvalued or undervalued, irrespective of his outlook for the underlying stock itself.

Volatility trading is a contrarian theory (反向理论) of investing. That is, when everyone else thinks the underlying is going to be nonvolatile, the volatility trader buys volatility. When everyone else is selling options and option buyers are hard to find, the volatility trader steps up to buy options.

## 36.7 WHY DOES VOLATILITY REACH EXTREMES?

If the trading volume has increased and if implied volatility has increased as well, it is a good warning sign that someone with inside information is buying the options. In such a case, it might not be a good idea to sell volatility, even though the options are mathematically expensive.

The seller of volatility can watch for two things as warning signs that perhaps the options are "predicting" a corporate event (and hence should be avoided as a "volatility sale"). Those two things are a dramatic increase in option volume or a sudden jump in implied volatility of the options.

### 36.7.1 A SUDDEN INCREASE IN OPTION VOLUME OR IMPLIED VOLATILITY

What distinguishes these arbitrage and hedging activities from the machinations of insider trading (内幕交易) is: (1) These is little propagation of option volume into other series in the "benign" case, and (2) the stock price itself may languish.
