# CHAPTER 36 The Basics of Volatility Trading

## 36.1 DEFINITIONS OF VOLATILITY

The historical volatility is a measure of how fast the underlying instrument has been changing in price.

The implied volatility is the option market's prediction of the volatility of the underlying over the life of the option.

Historical volatility can be measured with a formula for standard deviation.

## 36.4 IMPLIED VOLATILITY

If implied volatility is too high, options will be overpriced. That is, they will be relatively expensive. On the other hand, if implied volatility is too low, options will be cheap or underpriced.

## 36.5 THE VOLATILITY OF VOLATILITY

What this means is that one not only needs to know the current percentile of implied volatility, but he also needs to know the range of numbers over which that percentile was derived. If the range is wide, then an extreme percentile truly represents a cheap or expensive option. But if the range is tight, then one should probably not be overly concerned with the current percentile of implied volatility.

The range of implied volatility for near-term options is greater than it is for longer-term options.

It's important for anyone using implied volatility in his trading decisions to understand that the range of past implied volatilities is important, and to realize that the volatility range expands as time shrinks.

### IS IMPLIED VOLATILITY A GOOD PREDICTOR OF ACTUAL VOLATILITY?
