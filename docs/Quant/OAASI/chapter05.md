# CHAPTER 5 Naked Call Writing

## 5.1 THE UNCOVERED (NAKED) CALL OPTION

When one sells a call option without owning the underlying stock or any equivalent security, he is considered to have written an uncovered call option (无备兑看涨期权).

*Example*: XYZ is selling at 50 and a July 50 call is selling for 5. If one were to sell the July 50 call naked — without owning XYZ stock — he could make, at most, 5 points of profit. This profit would accrue if XYZ were at or anywhere below 50 at July expiration, as the call would then expire worthless. Should the stock climb to 100, the call would be at a price of 50. If the writer then covered (bought back) the call for a price of 50, he would have a loss of 45 points on the transaction.

Table 5-1 and Figure 5-1 (solid line) depict the results of this position at July expiration.
